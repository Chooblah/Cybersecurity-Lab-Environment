## 1. Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

Homelabs are a great way to get hands-on experience with and learn new concepts. What is a homelab though? In this case, it is a local machine that serves as a virtualization host that we will use to conduct testing and analysis. This will help in developing various skill-sets that align with both red-team and blue-team concepts.

## 2. Background <a name="background"></a>

Creating a homelab allowed me to practice red-team concepts and think about how I could put a blue-team spin on things. I started out performing investigations and exploitation on virtual machines from VulnHub. I, then, began turning those investigations into mock write-ups, more akin to what I would provide an actual stakeholder. The more time I spend learning in the lab, the more I want to learn! 

## 3. Don't Worry, Be Happy! <a name="dont-worry-be-happy"></a>

If someone is unfamiliar with virtualization, setting up a homelab may be a daunting task. Don't worry! I will break down each and every step of the setup. This setup will be operating on a host machine that is running on Fedora Linux, so your setup steps may vary slightly. Take as much time as you need to understand each step.

## 4. Objectives <a name="objectives"></a>

First and foremost, it is important to create a safe and isolated virtual environment were we can perform testing and analysis. This environment will be something you can return to frequently to strengthen both your skills and your understanding of both blue-team and red-team concepts. This project also aims to make learning these concepts fun by introducing a way to be hands-on with the learning.

## 5. Conclusion <a name="conclusion"></a>

Getting started with a homelab can be intimidating, if you aren't already familiar with setting virtual machines (VMs for short) up. I aim to document the steps for replicating and setting up my environment in a manner that is quick and easy to understand. If you need, read through everything more than once to make sure that you are understanding everything. That's the most important part!
